# Waste Segregation using YOLOv11

## Overview
This project leverages the YOLOv11 object detection model to classify and segregate waste into categories like recyclable, organic, and hazardous. The model is optimized for edge deployment, ensuring high efficiency and low latency.

## Objectives
- Develop an object detection pipeline for waste segregation.
- Optimize the YOLOv11 model for edge devices.
- Demonstrate the capability through a trained model.

## Methodology
1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Downloaded datasets using Roboflow.
   - Preprocessed images for model training.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Trained YOLOv11 on waste segregation datasets.
   - Fine-tuned the model for accuracy and performance.

3. **Optimization**:
   - Applied techniques like quantization for edge deployment.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Displayed inference results and training performance metrics.
